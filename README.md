<ins>**Robust, effective and resource efficient deep neural network for intrusion detection in IoT networks**</ins>

This project is focused on implementing a robust, resource-efficient algorithm for effective security solutions in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment. The chosen Articifial Inelligence technique for this project is Deep Neural Network (DNN). The project further provide a performance comparison against state-of-the-art approaches in terms of robustness and resource savings. Additionally, a comparison with the TensorFlow Lite model is incorporated in the pt737_tensrlte.py script.
